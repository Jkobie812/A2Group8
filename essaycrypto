Blockchain and cryptocurrencies is a fascinating development that is going on in the IT world, 
it changes the way we pay for stuff online and soon to be in person. Historic examples of such
developments include the internet, smartphones, cloud computing and public key cryptography

Blockchains is used on the internet as a record keeping technology behind bitcoin. There is a good
chance that it makes so much sense. Definition you have probably heard is: blockchain is a distributed,
decentralized, public ledger. Or you could call it a chain of blocks made up of digital pieces of information.
Includes 3 parts Stores information like the date, time, and dollar amount of your most recent purchase from Amazon.
Seceond thing blocks store information about who is participating in transactions, using a unique digital signature 
sort of like a username third part is it blocks store information that distinguishes them from the other blocks so 
I guess each block has a memory and calls each block a name to remember it by. Each block has a unique code called hash
Each one has a different unique code say if you made a purchase on amazon but while its in delivery you want another 
one even though your details of the new transaction is identical you can still tell the blocks apart bby the unique 
codes  

cryptocurrency based around the internet used to make trades in secret the most important
feature about cryptocurrency is that it is not controlled by any central authority: decentrilized nature of the 
blockchain makes cryptocurrencies immune to the old ways of government control and interference cryptocurrencies
can be sent between two people via the use of private and public keys avoiding the cost of major banks fees.
Bitcoin mining is performed by high powered computers that solve complex math problems
