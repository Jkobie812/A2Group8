> I have always had a personal interest in IT mostly from the perspective of video games, I spent my childhood playing video ames like the Legend of zelda andBanjo Kazooie, and other awesome nintendo games, and I became fascinated with the IT world. However, I never really considered a career in it because I was so focused on becoming an engineer. However, I eventually realised that my passion for problem solving could be used and applied in programming and development, and so I taught myself some python, and eventually decided to pursue a career in it because it seemed to fit with how I thought and processed the world. I have little to no professional experience in the IT world, but i'm excited to see where this degree takes me.
